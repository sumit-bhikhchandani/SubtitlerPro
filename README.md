# SubtitlerPro
Title:
Video Subtitle Generator

Description:
This Python script generates subtitles for a video based on its audio content. It utilizes the MoviePy library for video editing and the SpeechRecognition library for audio transcription.

Introduction:
The Video Subtitle Generator script takes a video file named "test.mp4" as input, extracts its audio, transcribes it using Google's speech recognition service, and generates SRT format subtitles accordingly. These subtitles are then overlaid onto the original video to create a final video with embedded subtitles.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
moviepy
SpeechRecognition
Installation:
Install Python 3.x from python.org.
Install the required dependencies using pip:
Usage:
Place your video file (test.mp4) in the same directory as the script.
Run the script:
python your_script.py
The script will generate two files:
output.srt: SRT format subtitles based on the audio transcription.
output_with_subtitles.mp4: Video file with embedded subtitles.
